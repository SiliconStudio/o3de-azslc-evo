# this test verifies that we can have a working 'transpiling rename' immediately after a line directive.
# it seemed during mcpp library integration, -on the builder side-, that renamings got affected
# by line directive. (the consequence is not proven, it may have been an earlier declaration broken)
# but better safe than sorry.
