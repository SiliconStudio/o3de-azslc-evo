// It looks like the original intent of this test was to show that lower number frequencies also got the lower number *registers*.
// Now that each SRG gets its own unique register space, the register *spaces* follow the same order as the frequencies.
// In either case, the order of the frequencies control the order of any indexing, not the order of appearance or the names.
